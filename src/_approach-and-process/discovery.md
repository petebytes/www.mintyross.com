title: Discovery
excerpt: |
  In the beginning, we go to great lengths to understand our partner's projects.
  We engage with our clients to get a better feel for what they value, where they are, and where they want to be.
  The unique value we bring is that we dig deep to understand our partner's business from their culture to their customers.
  As a team, we work together with partners to define a roadmap for projects through research and an honest assessment of our collective capabilities.

  We're good listeners.  We listen to your hopes, fears, and dreams to truly understand your business.
  What we learn from you we turn into research to that informs a roadmap for your project. 
  *  #### Learning
     We treat the client as a member of our own team to learn their business.
     
  *  #### Research
     Research guides our decision-making process.  We absorb as much knowledge as possible about the client's industry and explore all the possible options to meet their goals.
     
  *  #### Roadmap
     A mutual understanding of the plan and deliverables is a key component to any piece of collaborative work.  The roadmap for the project is defined in the discovery phase.
     
  *  #### Contract
     Once we feel we have an understanding and of the client's objectives and an agreed upon plan we our relationship official with a contract.
