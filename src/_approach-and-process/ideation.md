title: Ideation
excerpt: |
  Idea to implementation is the goal.  In this phase of the project we leverage the insight we gained during the engagement phase to get to a product.
  Ideation involves sharing our ideas and prototypes with our partners to narrow down to the most suitable solution.
    
description: |
  When we get to ideation we work closely with our partners to identify the best opportunities and deliver the best options.
  In this stage, we discuss strategy and how it relates to the user's experiences.
  The feedback we receive from back-and-forth collaboration in the ideation stage gets us closer to testing our hypotheses.
  * #### Strategy
    No two projects are identical.  We tailor a custom strategy to deliver on the goals of each project.
  
  * #### User Experience/Interaction
    Users, customers, clients whatever you call them they are the lifeblood of any business.  Experience matters and we get it right by collaborating with our partners.
  
  * #### Prototyping
    Prototypes turn words into projects. During prototyping, we test our hypotheses and solicit feedback from our partners and end users to prepare for refinement of the deliverables.
