        Minty Ross was created to take part in compelling opportunities in the branded good and service sectors.
        Our commitment to our partners is to use what we know to solve their problems.
        We work as partners with existing companies to foster their inherent creativity to build brands, digital platforms, experiences, and strategies that will reach and influence their audience.
        
        #### Perfecting the Art of Commerce
        Commerce is forever evolving.  What works now might not be suitable tomorrow and we perfect the art of commerce by staying abreast of these changes and bundling disciplines like user experience, branding, strategy, and web and app development to meet our partner's needs.
        We provide our clients with a wide range of services designed to uncover and solve hidden problems to make commerce work for them.
        Through easy to maintain solutions we help our partners navigate the ever-changing marketplace.
        Our hands-on approach means we do the work ourselves and by combining our deep understanding of how to market and promote with technology we can help our partners meet their goals.
        Long gone are the days when an organizations commerce needs could be served over one channel; now an emotional connection must be made with an audience through the digital and physical realms.
        We are here to develop more than just an outward express or illusion of success but compelling and unique experiences for customers which we achieve through brand building, conceiving plans for distribution and marketing, and developing networks.

        Our number one goal to is to meet our partner's goals.
        Because of that we are selective of who we partner with.
        If your primary goal is to get something done quick and cheap we probably wouldn't be a good fit. 
        The ideal project is something we can believe in done with a partner which whom we can connect with on a personal level.
        We believe there is no way we can create something great if we are not interested in it.
        We look for trustworthy passionate partners that are prepared with a goal and a target.
        The work we create is original work which we do ourselves; only under specific circumstances will we work on things we did not originate.
