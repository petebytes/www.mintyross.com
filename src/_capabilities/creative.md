  To be successful companies need to be differentiated from their audience's options.
  Creativity is key when separating winners from losers and creativity is best expressed through design, both aesthetic and functional.
  Since companies are in the business of solving their audience's problems creativity is essential in addressing how companies approach their audience's problems.
  Leading businesses like Apple, Airbnb, Nike, and Ikea have design at their core and a creative vision aligned with the business strategy.
  Creative design is good for business.
  Design facilitates interaction between users and a company's offering and good design creates a seamless path to a user's goals which attract customers and makes them come back.
  A company's goals are strongly tied to solving their audience's problems through design and making user interaction simple an efficient.
  At Minty Ross, we make products and services useful and understandable through design and creativity.
  When we work with our partners we don't stray from core purpose of the deliverable's but instead we work alongside the company's vision.
  Our selectivity means we care which results in better work and a better partnership.
  Visual design reflects the mood of brands and when the look and work of a business's offering is right customers are inclined to interact with that brand.
  Our creative work in digital and physical environments makes products useful and understandable from a functional, psychological, and aesthetic point-of-view.
